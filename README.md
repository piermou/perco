little to say about the project, easy and lazy way to scrap the big V.
3 options:
-parsing the html, get the ressources etc ...
-have access to the API ðŸ˜Ž, by tweaking the url ?
-using selenium, playwright, fancy

in fact parsing the html can be impossible, given the fact that the items wanted are
sometimes injected slightly after the base html appears ...

selenium etc ... would help you on that by waiting a little bit of time (time for the javascript to act)

so access the API is the best way, given the fact that it gives you a perfect json to work with

the only thing you have to do is buy IP address from provider and inject it into your requests
